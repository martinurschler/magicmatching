def nms_fast(in_corners, H, W, dist_thresh):
    """
    Run a faster approximate Non-Max-Suppression on numpy corners shaped:
      3xN [x_i,y_i,conf_i]^T
    Algo summary: Create a grid sized HxW. Assign each corner location a 1, rest
    are zeros. Iterate through all the 1's and convert them either to -1 or 0.
    Suppress points by setting nearby values to 0.
    Grid Value Legend:
    -1 : Kept.
     0 : Empty or suppressed.
     1 : To be processed (converted to either kept or supressed).
    NOTE: The NMS first rounds points to integers, so NMS distance might not
    be exactly dist_thresh. It also assumes points are within image boundaries.
    Inputs
      in_corners - 3xN numpy array with corners [x_i, y_i, confidence_i]^T.
      H - Image height.
      W - Image width.
      dist_thresh - Distance to suppress, measured as an infinty norm distance.
    Returns
      nmsed_corners - 3xN numpy matrix with surviving corners.
      nmsed_inds - N length numpy vector with surviving corner indices.
